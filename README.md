# CS305-Software-Security

Client Summary
    
    The client for this project was Artemis Financial. Artemis Financial wanted our company, Global Rain, to implement and apply the most current and effective software security to their RESTful web application prgramming interface.
    
What Went Well
  
  I think that an accurate vulnerability assessment was delivered. Being a financial institution, software security is an absolute necessity; there are many different financial communications that are sent between the server and clients which means the integrity of those messages need to be maintained. This is addressed well in the "Client Needs" section of the report. We then continue on and list the different areas where security is needed. Looking at the situation from a consumer's perspective, the different transaction requests that are going to be sent in addition to any other communication requests to the server need to be secure. Keeping this in mind, if a financial company does not have secure communications with their servers, this means that customer information and accounts is not safe. This will in turn cause customers to leave for more secure financial institutions.
  
  What was Helpful
  
    Working through the vulnerability report allowed me to take things a step at a time. This ensured that I was thinking about the different steps/aspects of developing secure software. This also meant that I was able to think about the different ways a financial institution would have potential security issues, and how those issues would potentially be exploited.
    
Layers of Security Approach
    
    Working through the different layers of security that are needed for a financial institution, left me with thinking about how to incorporate the different types of software security. Incorporating a hashing algorithm on the messages being sent between the client and server is a great way to help "hide" a person's sensitive information like names, birthdates, socials, and etc. Then using a check sum program on the message would allow to see if the message has been tampered with, and potentially lead to systems and hardware being hacked and/or information being leaked.
    
Functionality and Security
  
  I first went through a manual review of the code, looking for any obvious errors like syntax or compilation issues. Then I assessed the actual contents of the code to see what was already implementd; I did this while making note of issues that were there. The next step was to incorporate the Maven-Dependency check and generating the dependency reports. This allowed me to see where we could update to current versions of libraries; allowing for the fixing of different vulnerabilities that were caused by outdated libraries. After running through these different vulnerability checks and implementing the changes, running the vulnerability checks and compilation allowed me to check to see if there were any new vulnerabilities created from the changes, and to see if the program itself would work properly.

Resources and Tools

  The tools/resources that were used through out this project were the textbook, Google, and the different resources that were provided at the start of the module. The text book gave be a generalized understanding of what I would need to know to complete the tasks, while Google and the module resources allowed be to figure how to integrate the different requirements. Moving forward, as what was happening before, I will be using these tools to complete the tasks that will be put in front of me.
  
Employer Showcase

  What I would like future employers to see in this project is my ability to problem solve and my situational assessment skills. It does not matter what field a person works in, there will always be problems that need to be solved, and sutuations that need to be assessed. There are many instances in todays society where critical thinking, problem solving, and accurate assessments have almost become a superpower. Being able to figure out problems with minimal guidance is a trait that is needed in the workforce now more than ever.
